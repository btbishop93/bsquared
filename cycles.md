## Working on a Cycle

> **Important**: Follow the [Workflow Guide](./WORKFLOW.md) for the complete git workflow including feature branches and pull requests.

### Starting a New Cycle

1. Navigate to the cycle directory: `cd cycles/0X-cycle-name/`
2. Read the cycle README thoroughly
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/cycle-0X-task-001-description`
4. Start with task 001
5. Follow the task instructions
6. Open a PR when complete
7. Update progress in the cycle README after merge

### Completing a Task

1. Check all acceptance criteria
2. Run all tests in "Testing Your Work"
3. **Push branch and open a Pull Request**
4. After PR is reviewed and merged:
   - Mark task as complete in cycle README: `- [x]`
   - Update progress bar
   - Log session in session log
   - Commit progress update
5. Move to next task

**See [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for detailed PR process.**

### Completing a Cycle

1. Verify all success criteria met
2. Run end-to-end tests
3. Update cycle status to "Complete"
4. Update this file's progress tracker
5. Celebrate! 🎉
6. Plan next cycle if needed

## Commit Message Format

Following conventional commits:

```
<type>(<cycle>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Examples**:

- `feat(cycle-01): initialize monorepo structure`
- `feat(cycle-01): add echo functionality to TUI`
- `fix(cycle-01): correct WebSocket message parsing`

## Staying on Track

**Weekly Check-in Questions**:

- [ ] Am I on track to complete the cycle in 1-2 weeks?
- [ ] Are any tasks taking significantly longer than 1 hour?
- [ ] Do I need to adjust the scope or break tasks down further?
- [ ] Have I committed my work regularly?
- [ ] Am I blocked on anything?

**Motivation Tips**:

- 🎯 Focus on one task at a time
- ⏱️ Use 1-hour timeboxes
- ✅ Check off tasks frequently for quick wins
- 📝 Keep notes of learnings and blockers
- 🎉 Celebrate completing each cycle
- 🚀 Ship working features incrementally
